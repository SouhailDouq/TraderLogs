# 📊 Market Condition Guide - When to Use Which Strategy

## Overview
Your TraderLogs app now automatically analyzes market conditions and recommends which strategy to use. This ensures you're always trading with the market, not against it!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

The **Market Condition Indicator** appears at the top of both the Premarket Scanner and Trade Analyzer. It analyzes:

1. **SPY (S&P 500)** - Overall market direction
2. **VIX (Fear Index)** - Market volatility/fear
3. **Trend Analysis** - Bullish, bearish, or neutral
4. **SMAs** - 20-day and 50-day moving averages

---

## 📈 Market Conditions Explained

### 1. **TRENDING MARKET** 🚀
**What it means:**
- Market moving strongly in one direction (up or down)
- SPY change > 1% in a day
- Clear bullish or bearish trend
- Low to moderate VIX (< 25)

**Recommended Strategy:** **MOMENTUM BREAKOUT**
- ✅ Buy stocks making new highs
- ✅ Look for strong volume confirmation
- ✅ Ride the trend
- ❌ Don't fight the momentum

**Why it works:**
- In trending markets, strong stocks get stronger
- Momentum carries stocks higher
- Breakouts tend to follow through

**Example:**
```
SPY: +1.5% (Bullish trend)
VIX: 14.2 (Low fear)
→ Use Momentum Breakout Strategy
→ Look for stocks at 20-day highs with >1.5x volume
```

---

### 2. **RANGING MARKET** 📊
**What it means:**
- Market moving sideways without clear direction
- SPY change < 0.5% in a day
- Neutral trend (price bouncing between support/resistance)
- Low VIX (< 18)

**Recommended Strategy:** **MEAN REVERSION**
- ✅ Buy quality stocks on dips (-3% to -20%)
- ✅ Look for oversold conditions
- ✅ Expect bounce back to average
- ❌ Don't chase breakouts (they'll fail)

**Why it works:**
- In ranging markets, what goes down comes back up
- Stocks revert to their mean price
- Dips are buying opportunities

**Example:**
```
SPY: -0.2% (Neutral/sideways)
VIX: 15.8 (Low fear)
→ Use Mean Reversion Strategy
→ Look for quality stocks down -5% to -15% today
```

---

### 3. **VOLATILE MARKET** ⚡
**What it means:**
- High uncertainty and wild price swings
- VIX > 25 (moderate) or > 30 (high)
- Unpredictable movements
- Fear in the market

**Recommended Strategy:**
- **VIX 25-30:** Use BOTH strategies with caution (smaller positions)
- **VIX > 30:** STAY IN CASH or trade very small

**Why it works:**
- High volatility = high risk
- Both strategies can work but with lower win rates
- Better to wait for clearer conditions

**Example:**
```
SPY: -2.1% then +1.8% (whipsaw)
VIX: 28.5 (High fear)
→ CAUTION: Reduce position sizes by 50%
→ Or stay in cash and wait
```

---

### 4. **UNKNOWN/MIXED** ❓
**What it means:**
- Conflicting signals
- Transition period between market regimes
- Unclear direction

**Recommended Strategy:** Use BOTH with caution
- Only take highest-quality setups
- Smaller position sizes
- Be ready to exit quickly
