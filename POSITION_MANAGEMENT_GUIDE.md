# Position Management System - User Guide

## 🎯 What This System Does

This system enforces the discipline you need to overcome Trading 212's stop-loss limitations and break free from the "hold until green" trap that's costing you thousands.

---

## 🚨 The Problem You're Solving

**Your Current Situation:**
- €5k in profits (EXCELLENT momentum trading)
- €2k in unrealized losses (Poor exit discipline)
- 23 positions with -10% to -72% losses
- €17,724 trapped in losers instead of generating new profits
- Trading 212 stop-losses fail in after-hours (NVTS: set at $13.86, dropped to $12)

**The Math:**
- That €17k could rotate into 10-12 new momentum trades
- At 15% per trade = €2,550 - €3,060 in additional profits
- **You're leaving €5k+ on the table by holding losers**

## 🛠️ The 4 Tools You Now Have

### 1. **Stop-Loss Monitor** (Always Visible)

**What It Does:**
- Checks every position every 5 minutes
- **LOUD alerts** when any position hits -8% from entry
- Persistent banner you CANNOT dismiss without action
- Browser notifications + alarm sound
- Step-by-step Trading 212 sell instructions

**How to Use:**
1. Keep Portfolio Monitor page open during market hours (15:30-22:00 France time)
2. When alert fires: **YOU HAVE 5 MINUTES TO SELL**
3. Open Trading 212 → Find stock → Market Order → SELL
4. Come back and click "I've Sold This Position"

**Critical Rule:** 
- **-8% alert = SELL IMMEDIATELY**
- No "let me wait 5 more minutes"
- No "it might bounce back"
- **SELL WITHIN 5 MINUTES, NO EXCEPTIONS**

---

### 2. **Portfolio Triage** (Tab: "Position Triage")

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes all 23 positions
- Categorizes into Cut/Monitor/Hold
- Shows recovery probability (GameStop: 2% chance)
- Calculates opportunity cost of holding vs cutting
- Gives specific action for each position

**How to Use:**

#### 🔴 **Cut Immediately** (Down >40%)
**These stocks need +67% to +257% just to break even**

**Action TODAY:**
1. Open Trading 212
2. Sell ALL positions in this category
3. Accept the loss (it's already real, you're just acknowledging it)
4. Free up capital for next momentum trade

**Example:**
- GameStop -72% → Needs +257% to recover (2% probability)
- **Sell today, redeploy €X into next 15% winner = Net gain**

#### ⚠️ **Monitor Closely** (Down 10-40%)
**Set hard exit if drops another -8%**

**Action:**
- Check these HOURLY during market hours
- If any drops to the "Hard Exit Price" shown → SELL IMMEDIATELY
- Don't wait for it to get worse

#### ✅ **Hold & Track** (Down <10% or profitable)
**Within acceptable risk**

**Action:**
- Monitor with stop-loss alerts
- Set profit-taking limit orders if profitable

### 3. **Entry Quality Gate** (Tab: "Trading Tools")

**What It Does:**
- **BLOCKS you from making bad trades**
- Checks 5 criteria BEFORE you buy
- Shows red ❌ or green ✓ for each requirement
- Only shows "PROCEED" when ALL criteria met

**The 5 Non-Negotiable Rules:**

1. **Position Limit:** <5 open positions
   - If you have 5 → You CANNOT buy until you close one
   
2. **Time Window:** 10:00-11:00 France time ONLY
   - First hour of premarket = best momentum
   - Outside this window = DO NOT TRADE
   
3. **Score ≥75:** Not 60, not 70
   - Filters out mediocre setups
   
4. **MACD Bullish:** Not bearish divergence
   - Prevents buying into reversals
   
5. **Relative Volume >2.5x:** Not 1.5x
   - Ensures REAL momentum, not noise

**How to Use:**
1. See a stock you want to buy?
2. Enter symbol in Entry Quality Gate
3. Click "Check"
4. If ANY criteria shows ❌ → **DO NOT TRADE**
5. Only buy if ALL show ✓

**This prevents your NVTS disasters BEFORE they happen**

### 4. **Profit-Taking Calculator** (Tab: "Trading Tools")

**What It Does:**
- Calculates exact limit order prices for Trading 212
- Shows 3-tier ladder: 8%, 15%, 25%
- Gives step-by-step Trading 212 instructions
- Removes emotion from profit-taking

**How to Use:**

**IMMEDIATELY after buying any stock:**

1. Enter entry price and shares in calculator
2. Copy the 3 limit order prices shown
3. Open Trading 212 → Your position → SELL
4. Create 3 separate limit orders:

**Order 1: +8% Target (Conservative)**
- Sell 33% of shares
- Limit price: $X.XX (calculator shows exact price)
- Good Till Cancelled (GTC)
- **This GUARANTEES profit even if stock reverses**

- GTC
- **Your main target**

**Order 3: +25% Target (Aggressive)**

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **"Let me wait one more day"**
**Reality:** That -40% position won't magically recover. Cut it today.

### ❌ **"But I set a stop-loss on Trading 212"**
**Reality:** It failed on NVTS, it will fail again. Use the app's manual monitoring.

### ❌ **"This stock looks good, I'll skip the Entry Quality Gate"**
**Reality:** That's how you got 23 losing positions. Use the gate EVERY TIME.

### ❌ **"I'll set profit-taking orders later"**
**Reality:** You won't. Set them IMMEDIATELY after buying or you'll hold too long.

### ❌ **"I can handle more than 5 positions"**
**Reality:** No, you can't. That's why you have 23 positions with €2k in losses.

## 💪 The Bottom Line

**You're already a good trader** - €5k profit in a few months proves it.

**You just need discipline** - to cut losers fast and let winners run.

**This system enforces that discipline** - because Trading 212 won't do it for you.

**The choice is yours:**
- Keep holding 23 losers, hoping they recover (they won't)
- Or cut them today, free up €10k, and make €1,500+ in the next month

**The math is clear. The tools are built. Now execute.**
